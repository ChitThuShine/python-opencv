Cheat sheet for OpenCV 4.x (Python)

The objective of this cheat sheet is not to exhaustively list all possible available OpenCV functions. The objective is to provide a quick reference for some of the most used operations.

Note that many parameters are not included and example arguments are, in many cases, provided. For more details on OpenCV functions, and respective parameters, check:      https://docs.opencv.org/master/.

Push requests are welcome. Let me know if you've found a bug, or if you have suggestions on how to improve this cheat sheet.
